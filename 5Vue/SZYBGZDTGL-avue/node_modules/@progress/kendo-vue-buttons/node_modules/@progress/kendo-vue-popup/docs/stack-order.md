# Stack Order

The Popup component is often used with other components, such as the DropDownList or the DatePicker, to display specific related content.

To render the Popup on top of the other elements, set its `z-index` by using CSS. By default, the `z-index` of the Popup is 100.

If you use the Popup inside components whose `z-index` is higher than the `z-index` of the Popup (for example, the [Dialog]({% slug overview_dialog_native %}), you have to increase the `z-index` stack order of the Popup element over CSS.

```jsx-no-run
    .k-animation-container {
        z-index: 10003 // set the desired value based on the application requirements
    }
```
