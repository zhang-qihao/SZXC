# Viewport Boundary Detection

The Popup enables you to set its boundary detection functionality by using the [`collision`]({% slug api_popup_native_popupprops %}#toc-collision) property.

The property specifies the behavior of the component when it does not fit in the view port. By default, the Popup fits horizontally and flips vertically.
