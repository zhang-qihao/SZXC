# Getting Started with KendoVue Popup

The KendoVue Popup positions a piece of content next to a specific anchor component.

The KendoVue Popup component is part of the KendoVue library of Vue UI components. It is distributed through NPM under the [kendo-vue-popup package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@progress/kendo-vue-popup).

## Basic Usage

The following example demonstrates the Popup in action.

{% meta height:300 %}
{% embed_file basic/main.vue preview %}
{% embed_file basic/main.js %}
{% embed_file basic/styles.css %}
{% endmeta %}

## Installation

To initialize the Popup, either:

* [Use the CDN service](#toc-using-cdn), or
* [Use Webpack](#toc-initializing-with-webpack).

### Using CDN

You need to reference the popup package, in order to be able to use the Kendo Native Popup for Vue.

```sh
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@progress/kendo-vue-popup@latest/dist/cdn/js/kendo-vue-popup.js"></script>
```

### Initializing with Webpack

1. Download and install the package. Use Node.js v5.0.0 or later.

    ```sh
    npm install --save @progress/kendo-vue-popup @progress/kendo-licensing
    ```

2. Once installed, import the package module.

   ```jsx-no-run
    // ES2015 module syntax
    import { Popup } from '@progress/kendo-vue-popup';
    ```
    ```jsx-no-run
    // CommonJS format
    const { Popup } = require('@progress/kendo-vue-popup');
    ```

3. You are required to install one of the Kendo UI themes to style your components. For more information on how to add the styles, refer to the article on [getting started]({% slug getting_started %}#toc-adding-the-styles).

4. Follow the instructions on the Kendo UI for Vue [My License page]({% slug my_license_vue_native %}) to activate your license. You can skip this step if your application already contains a Kendo UI license file.

The Popup package requires you to install the following [peer dependencies](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/npm/peer-dependencies/) in your application:

* vue 2.6.11* and 3.0.0*
