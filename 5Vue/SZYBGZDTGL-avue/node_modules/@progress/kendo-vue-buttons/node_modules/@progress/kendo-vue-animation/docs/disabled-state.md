# Disabled Animations

The Animations allow you to enable or disable their showing or hiding effect.

The control over the disabled animation state results in an instant element display or its disappearance. By default, the Expand, Push, Reveal and Slide animations apply the showing or hiding effect. To disable these effects, set the [`enter`]({% slug api_animation_native_animationprops %}#toc-enter) or, respectively, the [`exit`]({% slug api_animation_native_animationprops %}#toc-exit) property to `false`.
