# Getting Started with Kendo UI for Vue Animation

The KendoVue Animation uses the [`TransitionGroup`](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/transitions-overview.html#class-based-animations-transitions) component to animate elements which appear, enter, or exit the viewport.

The KendoVue Animation component is part of the Kendo UI for Vue library of Vue UI components. It is distributed through NPM under the [kendo-vue-animation package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@progress/kendo-vue-animation).

## Basic Usage

The following example demonstrates the Fade, Expand, Push, Reveal and Slide Animation in action.

{% meta height:400 %}
{% embed_file overview/main.vue preview %}
{% embed_file overview/main.js %}
{% embed_file overview/styles.css %}
{% endmeta %}

## Functionality and Features

* [Configuration]({% slug configuration_animation_native %})
* [Types]({% slug animationtypes_animation_native %})
* [Disabled animations]({% slug disabledstate_animation_native %})
* [Duration]({% slug duration_animation_native %})
* [Direction]({% slug direction_animation_native %})
* [Customization]({% slug customizing_animation_native %})
* [Appearance]({% slug appearance_animation_native %})

The Push Animations further extend the [`Animation`]({% slug api_animation_native_animationprops %}) component, which is commonly inherited by all Animation types, and enable you to stack animations.

## Installation

To initialize the Animation, either:

* [Use the CDN service](#toc-using-cdn), or
* [Use Webpack](#toc-initializing-with-webpack).

### Using CDN

You need to reference the animation package, in order to be able to use the Kendo Native Animation for Vue.

```sh
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@progress/kendo-vue-animation@latest/dist/cdn/js/kendo-vue-animation.js"></script>  
```

### Initializing with Webpack

1. Download and install the package. Use Node.js v5.0.0 or later.

    ```sh
    npm install --save @progress/kendo-vue-animation @progress/kendo-licensing
    ```

1. Once installed, import the package module.

   ```jsx-no-run
    // ES2015 module syntax
    import { Fade } from '@progress/kendo-vue-animation';
    ```
    ```jsx-no-run
    // CommonJS format
    const { Fade } = require('@progress/kendo-vue-animation');
    ```

1. You are required to install one of the Kendo UI themes to style your components. For more information on how to add the styles, refer to the article on [getting started]({% slug getting_started %}#toc-adding-the-styles).

1. Follow the instructions on the Kendo UI for Vue [My License page]({% slug my_license_vue_native %}) to activate your license. You can skip this step if your application already contains a Kendo UI license file.

## Dependencies

The Animation package requires you to install the following [peer dependencies](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/npm/peer-dependencies/) in your application:

* vue 2.6.11* and 3.0.0*
* @progress/kendo-licensing
