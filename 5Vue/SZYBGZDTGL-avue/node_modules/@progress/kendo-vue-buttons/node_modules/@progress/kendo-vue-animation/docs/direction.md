# Direction

Except for the Fade Animation, the Animations provide a set of the predefined directions which allow you to control their entering and exiting effects.

> The Fade Animation does not feature a configurable direction because it represents a transition in the opacity of the element.

To define the direction of the entering and exiting animations, use the `direction` property of each Animation type.
- [`ExpandDirection`]({% slug api_animation_native_expanddirection %})
- [`PushDirection`]({% slug api_animation_native_pushdirection %})
- [`RevealDirection`]({% slug api_animation_native_revealdirection %})
- [`SlideDirection`]({% slug api_animation_native_slidedirection %})
