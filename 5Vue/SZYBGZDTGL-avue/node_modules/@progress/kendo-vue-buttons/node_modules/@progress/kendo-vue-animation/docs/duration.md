# Duration

All Animation types enable you to control the duration of the entering and exiting animation effects.

To configure the duration, define the [`transitionEnterDuration`]({% slug api_animation_native_animationprops %}#toc-transitionenterduration) or, respectively, the [`transitionExitDuration`]({% slug api_animation_native_animationprops %}#toc-transitionExitDuration) property. The passed value represents the duration of the animation in milliseconds.
